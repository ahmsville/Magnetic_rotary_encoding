The **Pico Dev M3** is a development board based on Raspberry Pi's **RP2040 microcontrolle**r chip, the board is also a high-resolution **magnetic rotary encoder** when paired with a few 3D printed parts, which makes this the perfect board for applications and projects that can benefit from having a rotary encoder, a good example is making macro pads, and other similar secondary controllers.

## **Board Features**
- RP2040 chip, Dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+ processor at 133 MHz
- 264kB on-chip SRAM
- 128Mb on-board QSPI flash
- 19 multifunction GPIO pins, with 2 analog inputs
- 2 UARTs
- 2 SPI controllers
- 2 I2C controllers
- 16 PWM channels
- USB 1.1 controller with host and device support
- 8 PIO state machines
- USB type C
- Lipo charging
- onboard Button input
- Addressable Led ring (18 LEDs)

## **Encoder Features**

- The onboard encoder features a base resolution of **36 steps, extending up to 36000** steps per revolution.
- Thereâ€™s also a ring of **18 individually addressable LEDs** on board.
- Features a ball bearing which gives the encoder a significantly smoother feel compared to traditional rotary encoders.
- Customizable 3d printed encoder. 
- Implementing the encoder is also really straightforward using the dedicated Libraries and Sample Codes
- Easy mounting options

### **Programming Language:**

- **RP2040 C/C++ SDK** 
- **Micropython**

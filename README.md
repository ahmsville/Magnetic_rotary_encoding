# Magnetic_rotary_encoding

This library was written based on the rotation detection method described @ https://youtu.be/atb6d4b-VYk and also in the pdf included with the library, so if you intend to use said method for detecting rotations in your projects, this library will come in handy. The library also features a haptics controller which allows you to connect and control a vibration motor as a step count haptic feedback.
